# task-tracker

### User Story
As a task manager, I want a close button within the task details view so that I can easily navigate back to the task list without going through extra steps.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The close button should be clearly visible within the task details view.
- Clicking the close button should return the user to the task list.

### User Story
As a system user, I want the application to have a robust and performant backend API built with Express.js so that I can interact with the task management system seamlessly.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The Express.js API should handle CRUD operations for tasks.
- API routes should be well-organized and follow RESTful principles.
- Proper error handling should be implemented for all API endpoints.

### User Story
As a system user, I want the application to use MongoDB as its database system so that task data can be stored persistently and efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
- MongoDB should be integrated as the database for storing task-related information.
- The database connection should be established securely.
- Data models should be designed to represent tasks accurately.

### User Story
As a quality assurance tester, I want to have a suite of small tests for the backend to ensure that the task management system operates reliably and meets its requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests, integration tests, and/or end-to-end tests should be written to cover critical functionality in the backend.
- Tests should be organized, and each test case should have clear expectations.
- The test suite should be able to run automatically as part of the development and deployment process.
